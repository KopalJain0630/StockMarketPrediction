Stock Market Prediction
This project aims to accurately predict and plot stock market trends and prices, which can help in enhancing investment strategies and decision-making processes.
I obtained a an RMSE of 141.4 for the training dataset and 236.4 for the testing dataset by optimizing the model architecture and hyperparameters.

Steps followed:
1. Utilizing various preprocessing techniques like normalization on a time-series dataset comprising of daily variations in stock prices.
2. Developing a Stack LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the test data and plot the output.
3. Predicting and plotting stock prices based on historical data for the future 30 days.
